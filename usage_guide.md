# ðŸš— Nettiauto Bot User Guide ðŸš—

Welcome to the Nettiauto Bot! This guide will help you understand how to use the bot to find car listings from Nettiauto.com directly in your Discord server.

---

## A. Getting Started (Admin Only)

Before anyone can use the bot, an administrator needs to invite it to your Discord server.



---

## B. How the Bot Works

The bot works in two main ways:

1.  **Scheduled Alerts:** It automatically checks Nettiauto.com every hour for new car listings that match your server's saved criteria.
2.  **Manual Scraping:** You can also trigger a manual search at any time using a command.

---

## C. Manual Scraping: `/scrap`

Want to check for new cars right now? Use the `/scrap` command!

*   **Command:** `/scrap`
*   **What it does:** Triggers an immediate search for cars based on your server's configured filters.
---

## D. Understanding Car Alerts

When the bot finds a car that matches your criteria, it will post a detailed message (called an "embed") in your notification channel.


Each alert will include:
*   **Title:** The make and model of the car.
*   **Price:** How much the car costs.
*   **Location:** Where the car is located.
*   **Year:** The car's model year.
*   **Mileage:** How many kilometers the car has driven.
*   **Engine Size:** The size of the car's engine.
*   **Fuel Type:** The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Bensiini, Diesel).
*   **Link:** A direct link to the car's listing on Nettiauto.com.
*   **Image:** A picture of the car.

## F. Important Notes

*   **Permissions:** Only users with the `Manage Guild` permission in Discord can use the configuration commands.
*   **Restart Bot:** After making changes to the configuration using commands, the bot might need a restart (by its owner) for some changes (like the scraping interval) to take full effect.
*   **Filtering Logic:** The bot will only post cars that match *all* the filters you set. If you set too many strict filters, you might not get any results!
*   **Troubleshooting:** If the bot isn't posting anything, check your `/show_config` to ensure your filters are not too restrictive and that the URLs are correct.
